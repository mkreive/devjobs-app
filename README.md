## Overview

FrontendMentor challenge to create jobs app with filtering. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-   Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
-   Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
-   **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
